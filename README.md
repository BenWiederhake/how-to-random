## Usage

Just use it!  It's written in python3, which basically everyone has, and has no additional dependencies.

Here's an example run:

```
$ ./how_to_random.py
Fetching page ... chose Become-a-Reflexologist
Fetching image ... chose Step 3
Written to aid1353564-v4-900px-Become-a-Reflexologist-Step-3-Version-2_by-nc-sa-3.0_Wikivisual.jpg

Have a great day!
```

There's also a way to use it in a pipeline:

```
$ ./how_to_random.py --pipe-out
{"title": "Become-a-Reflexologist", "image": {"filename": "aid1353564-v4-900px-Become-a-Reflexologist-Step-3-Version-2_by-nc-sa-3.0_Wikivisual.jpg", "copyright": "Wikivisual", "data_base64": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEASABIAAD//gBXRmlsZSBzb3VyY2U6IGh0dHA6Ly93d3cud2lraWhvdy5jâ€¦"}}
```

Or from a python program, if you copy it into your project:

```
import how_to_random

how_ro_random.fetch_stuff()  # TODO
```

## TODOs

* Implement it

## NOTDOs

Here are some things this project will definitely not support:
* "Fast" or "complete" crawling.
* Any kind of "guarantee" that the copyright parsing always succeeds (but it should be quite robust).
* Nicer output methods
